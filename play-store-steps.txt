# Google Play Store vs CloudFront Distribution

## Current CloudFront Setup:
- Direct download: https://d3oizrvu0zqcqz.cloudfront.net/
- Purpose: Immediate access, no app store needed
- Users manually install APK files

## Google Play Store Submission:
CloudFront and Play Store are SEPARATE - you need both!

# Google Play Store Release Steps:

# 1. Install EAS CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g @expo/eas-cli

# 2. Login to EAS
eas login

# 3. Build for Play Store (creates AAB file)
eas build --platform android --profile production

# 4. Download the AAB file when build completes
# (EAS will provide download link)

# 5. Upload AAB to Google Play Console:
# - Go to https://play.google.com/console/
# - Create new app or select existing
# - Upload AAB file
# - Fill in store listing details
# - Submit for review

# Alternative: Auto-submit to Play Store
# eas submit --platform android --profile production
