# Cost Optimization Options for Spirited Travels Africa

## Current Setup (Recommended - Professional)
- CloudFront + Private S3
- Cost: ~$0.02-$2/month
- Benefits: Global CDN, security, professional URLs

## Ultra-Low-Cost Alternative (If needed)
If you want to go back to minimal costs:

1. Keep S3 bucket private (security maintained)
2. Generate signed URLs for downloads
3. Remove CloudFront distribution
4. Cost: ~$0.02/month + $0.09/GB transfer

## Commands to Switch to Ultra-Low-Cost:
# Delete CloudFront distribution
aws cloudfront delete-distribution --id ERCX7LSQV0GC2 --if-match E3V819E2DJKBAV

# Create signed URL script for downloads
# (Would require a simple Node.js script)

## Recommendation:
Keep current setup - the free tier covers typical usage and provides:
- Global performance
- Security  
- Professional appearance
- No surprise costs
